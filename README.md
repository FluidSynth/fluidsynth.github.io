# fluidsynth.org website

This repository contains the sources of the www.fluidsynth.org website. It is hosted
on GitHub pages, the site itself is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Local Preview

If you want to make changes to this site and preview them locally before committing or
opening a pull request, you will need to be able to run Jekyll locally. Here is
a quickstart on how to install Jekyll on a recent Ubuntu. For installation on other platforms, please
consult the [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

### Install dependencies

```
sudo apt install install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev ruby-bundler
```

### Bundle install and serve

Assuming you have checkout out the `fluidsynth.github.io` repository and switched
into the root of that directory, simply execute the following line to install
all required ruby packages:
```
bundle install
```

Now you can start the preview server with the following command and view the
site on http://localhost:4000
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Site file structure

### Recent News

To add a news article to the site, simply create a new file in the `_posts`
directory. The filename should be `YYYY-MM-DD-slug-name-of-the-article.md` and
the file contain the following [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):
```
---
title: My New Post Title
author: Somebody
layout: post
---

This is the content of the news article. You can use any valid markdown.
```

### Autogenerated API Docs

The API docs in `/api` are kept up-to-date automatically by a GitHub action on
the [FluidSynth/fluidsynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth)
repository. It runs the doxygen build on every change to master and commits the
changes into this folder. Manual changes to the contents of the `/api` folder
will therefore be overwritten after the next commit in the
FluidSynth/fluidsynth repo.

The files in `/api-1.x` contain the legacy API documentation. This directory is
static and not built automatically.


### Main navigation

The main navigation is created from the data file in `_data/nav.yml`.


### Screenshots

Screenshots and images for the home page carousel are located in
`/assets/img/`, the definition of the screenshots, their titles etc are defined
in `_data/screenshots.yml`.
