# FluidSynth
**A SoundFont Synthesizer**

**FluidSynth** is a real-time software synthesizer based on the SoundFont 2
specifications and has reached widespread distribution. FluidSynth itself does
not have a graphical user interface, but due to its powerful API several
applications utilize it and it has even found its way onto embedded systems and
is used in some mobile apps.

## Features

- Cross platform support (Linux, macOS and Windows to name a few)
- SoundFont 2 support
- SoundFont 3 support (vorbis-compressed SF2)
- Realtime effect control using SoundFont 2.01 modulators
- Limited support for Downloadable Sounds (DLS) Level 1 & 2
- Playback of MIDI files
- Shared library which can be used in other programs
- Built in command line shell

A detailed chart of supported MIDI messages can be found <a
