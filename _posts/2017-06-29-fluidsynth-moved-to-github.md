Dear all,

fluidsynth has moved to <https://www.github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth><br/>
Issues and code have already been migrated. Migrating the wiki is under way.

The move to github will hopefully make things easier for collaboration and contribution. **We therefore kindly ask everyone having a custom fork of fluidsynth at github to create pull requests to bring their changes back to upstream.** Meanwhile we are getting some new members into the dev team next to David, Element, Pedro and Peter. After some consolidation and planning during the next week(s) weâ€™ll probably have a minor maintenance release later this year, so any stability improvements or bug fixes are welcome.

Also note that the old issue tracker at sourceforge has hereby become obsolete and will not be maintained any more. Please file new issues at github. Old issues were migrated from sourceforge and remain valid.
