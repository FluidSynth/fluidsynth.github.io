A maintenance release for fluidsynth has been released.

Highlights of this release include the support of MuseScoreâ€™s vorbis compressed SF3 files. We also addressed a license issue and consistently re-licensed fluidsynth under the terms of the LGPL-2.1+. As usual there are plenty of bug fixes and a few other new features. Details can be found in the release notes:
