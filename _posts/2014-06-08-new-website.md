Welcome to the new FluidSynth website.  After SourceForge announced that it was discontinuing the hosted Trac service, I decided it was about time to give the FluidSynth website a makeover.  I added an [Application Screenshots](/screenshots/) section which shows some of the applications which utilize FluidSynth.  Most of the other links on the navigation menu go to SourceForge services at the moment, such as the Wiki, where all of the previous documentation resides and continues to be user modifiable.  Bug and feature request tickets are now hosted on the SourceForge [Ticket System](http://sourceforge.net/p/fluidsynth/tickets/).  Please feel free to [Contact](/contact/) me if you find any issues with the website or have any suggestions.
